# Fish market

The idea of this git repository is to collect fish scripts at a central place.
There are many nice shell scripts scattered over a zillion of web servers. Let's
try to share them with others.

# How to contribute

If you want to share a fish script, send a pull request. There are almost no
restrictions. You should provide `README` file which explains the functions in
the script with all available parameters. In case anybody needs help, it would
be nice to have some contact information of the author as well. Put a few
important keywords in the `taglist.md` file. 

# Tag list

The `taglist.md` file can be checked for keywords with your favorite
pager/editor in order to find interesting scripts.
